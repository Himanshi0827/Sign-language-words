# Translation App For Sign Language
# About
Participating in DevsHouse '24 at VIT Chennai was an incredible experience, collaborating with Jemmy Dalsaniya, Ronit Shah, and Shaily Patel to address communication barriers faced by mute individuals. Our project, a Translation App For Sign Language, aimed to bridge the gap between the mute community and the general population using AI/ML technologies.

# Project Overview
Our solution incorporated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and a Large Language Model (LLM) to recognize ASL gestures and translate them into text or speech. This enhanced inclusivity and accessibility for speech-impaired individuals, contributing to a more connected world.

# Key Features
# Real-time Gesture Translation:
Translate ASL gestures into spoken or written language using CNNs and webcam feed.
# Multilingual Translation: 
Translate recognized gestures into sentences in all native languages of India (Integrate Google Cloud Translation API).
# Speech-to-Text Conversion: 
Enable speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion for seamless communication.
# Community Engagement: 
Foster community, accessibility, and communication improvement for speech-impaired individuals.
# Privacy and Data Security: 
Ensure data privacy and security throughout the application.
